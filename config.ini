# This supports the following using DateParser library:
#   - h  (hourly)
#   - d  (daily)
#   - w  (weekly)
#   - m  (monthly)
# Examples:
# delta_time = "1h"  1 sample every hour (highest possible frequency)
# delta_time = "1d"  1 sample every day
# delta_time = "14d" 1 sample every 2 weeks
# delta_time = "2w"  1 sample every 2 weeks
# delta_time = "1m"  1 sample every month
# delta_time = "12m" 1 sample every year

# What variables to download

# This supports "all_pressure_level_vars", "all_single_level_vars" or a comma separated list of variables:
# - "temperature"
# - "u_component_of_wind,v_component_of_wind"
# - "10m_u_component_of_wind,10m_v_component_of_wind"
# - "all_pressure_level_vars"
# - "all_single_level_vars"
# Note that you cannot mix single level and pressure level variables in the same download
# Currently supported variables can be found in src/dmd_era5/constants.py

# What pressure levels to download. Only relevant if downloading pressure level variables.
